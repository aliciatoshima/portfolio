        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a 2017 graduate from Reed College in Portland, OR with a B.A. in Mathematics-Economics. My thesis project focuses on how the amount of financial aid affects undergraduate GPA. I was involved in the Reed College Orchestra (I play flute and piccolo) and continue to play the flute in my spare time. I'm back in Portland (from Oklahoma) and work as a Marketing Analyst at Vacasa (great to be back!) and work mostly with SQL and data (a lot of data) at the moment.</p>

            <h4>Partner: Marina Poltorak</h4>
            <p>Marina and I worked on a this <a href="https://github.com/aliciatoshima/nemo_1.git" target="_blank">Fake Nemo</a> project together. This exercise was to familiarize oursleves with floats and classes. This project is only called "Fake Nemo" becuase I could not get a real photo of Nemo to come up on the website, so I substituted with a random cat on the internet that looked vaguely like Nemo and we rolled with it. <strong> HTML and CSS used.</strong></p>

                <p>During this time, I worked as an acquisitions analyst in the Revenue department.</p>

              <p>In my role as Financial Services Counselor, my duties regarding patient interaction were to take hospital and doctors’ side payments, answer patient balance inquiries, and provide information on the insurance billing process. My primary responsibility was to assist in running and reviewing the statements and collections reports as well as the financial assistance program. I communicated daily with billers and registrars to ensure correct and accurate billing information is utilized to bill patients' insurance. I was also responsible for transitioning accounts into bad debt (collections) and making sure A/R and bad debt accounts balance. I made sure to build and send statement reports weekly to Midland (contracted payment plan company), CBSA (primary collections), AMR (secondary collections), and LetterLogic (statement generation corporation). I primarily used CPSI and InSync (electronic medical records and billing software) to check patient accounts for correct balancing and charging and to run and generate statements and statement reports.</p>
